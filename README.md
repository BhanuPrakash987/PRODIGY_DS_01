Population Dataset Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a population dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization tasks to understand population-related metrics.

Project Overview
The population dataset provides information on various indicators related to population statistics. The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Country Name: Name of the country
Country Code: ISO code of the country
Indicator Name: Name of the population indicator
Indicator Code: Code for the indicator
Yearly columns (e.g., 1960, 1961, ..., 2023): Population statistics for each year
Unnamed: 68: Unnamed column, possibly for additional data or metadata
Contents
population_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.
data/: Directory containing the population dataset file.

Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data transformations, and preparation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and other visualizations to illustrate key findings.
Results
The analysis includes insights into various population indicators, trends over time, and visual representations of key metrics.
